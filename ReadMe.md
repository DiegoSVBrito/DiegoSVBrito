## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate **Data Analyst** from Brazil, actively working and studying in the data field since 2022. Currently completing a **bachelor’s degree in Cloud Computing** and an **MBA in Data Science**.

I specialize in **SQL**, **Python**, **data modeling**, **ETL**, and **Power BI**. My work focuses on transforming raw information into meaningful insights that support decision-making and deliver measurable impact.

With a background in **Law**, I developed critical thinking and problem-solving skills that now enhance my analytical approach to complex data challenges. I believe in the power of simplicity and storytelling through data.
