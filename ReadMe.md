##  About Me
I'm a passionate **Data Analyst** from Brazil, actively working and studying in the data field since 2022. Currently, Iâ€™m completing a **bachelorâ€™s degree in Cloud Computing** and an **MBA in Data Science**. 

Professionally, I specialize in **SQL**, **Python**, **data modeling**, and **visualization**. My work focuses on transforming raw information into meaningful insights that drive smarter decisions and create real business value. 

Before venturing into data analytics, I built a career in **Law**, which sharpened my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This structured mindset allows me to approach data challenges with clarity and precision.
