Junior Data Scientist As a data science enthusiast with a background in law and a passion for problem-solving, I bring a unique perspective to the world of data 
analysis. With intermediate skills in Python and SQL, and a solid understanding of programming logic, I am excited to apply my technical abilities to complex business problems.
In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong communication and analytical skills, and am fluent in English. My legal background, with a specialization in constitutional 
Brazilian law and international contracts workshop, has equipped me with the ability to analyze complex legal and policy documents and translate them into actionable insights.
Having worked as a Legal Analyst for the past 12 years, I have a proven track record of success in analyzing complex legal and policy documents, drafting contracts and legal opinions, 
and providing strategic advice to senior management. I have also led several IT-related projects, including the development of a database to track legal cases and the incorporation of data analytics into the legal 
decision-making process.
